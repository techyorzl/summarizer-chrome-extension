# T5-Summarizer ðŸš€  

This repository contains a **summarization tool** built as a Chrome extension, using a transformer-based model to generate concise summaries of text.  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
The initial goal was to **fine-tune the T5 base model** on the **CNN/Daily Mail dataset** for improved summarization performance. However, due to **compute limitations**, the fine-tuning process was infeasible within the available resourcesâ€”my **Kaggle notebook crashed** due to memory constraints.  

As a result, the final implementation **uses a pre-trained model via Hugging Faceâ€™s `pipeline`**, ensuring efficient summarization while maintaining quality.  

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents  
- **ðŸ”¬ Fine-Tuning Attempt:**  
  - Contains the Kaggle notebook where I attempted fine-tuning.  
  - Highlights the challenges faced due to compute limitations.  
- **âš¡ Final Implementation:**  
  - A FastAPI backend serving the summarization model.  
  - A simple Chrome extension that integrates with the backend.  
- **ðŸ“ˆ Future Improvements:**  
  - If better computational resources become available, I plan to **revisit fine-tuning** for optimized performance.  

## ðŸ”§ Installation & Usage
